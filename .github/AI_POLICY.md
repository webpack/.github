# Use of LLMs and similar tools


## Using AI to create commits

Contributions that are based on AI-assisted tooling needs to be understood by the person contributing. If an issue, pull request or comment indicates that AI is used without a human understanding the concept, the corresponding issue, pull request or comment will ble closed. 

## Using AI to co-review

If a user has created a pull request the author or reviewee is free to use LLM based tools to assist in reviewing the code changes.

## Other

**ALL** issues, pull requests and comments are required to be manually written by the author. If not, the maintainers in a repository will automatically delete/close the work done. If one really needs to use AI when interacting with webpack, it should be on an "assist" basis to fill inn small holes rather than creating content from scratch.
