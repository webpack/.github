# Use of AI tools and LLM based products


Contributions that are based on AI-assisted tooling needs to be understood by the person contributing. If an issue, pull request or comment indicates that AI is used without a human understanding the concept, the corresponding issue, pull request or comment will be closed. 

If a user has created a pull request the author or reviewee is free to use LLM based tools to assist in reviewing the code changes. For instance, this could be to proof-read a script or documentation. 

**ALL** issues, pull requests and comments are required to be manually written in some way by the author. If not, the maintainers in a repository will automatically delete/close the work done. If one really needs to use AI when interacting with webpack, it should be on an "assist" basis to fill inn small knowledge gaps.
