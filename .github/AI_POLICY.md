# Use of AI tools and LLM based products


Contributions that are based on AI-assisted tooling needs to be understood by the person contributing. If an issue, pull request or comment indicates that AI is used without a human understanding the concept, the corresponding issue, pull request or comment will be closed. 

If a user has created a pull request the author or reviewee, is allowed to use LLM based tools to assist in reviewing code changes. For instance, this could be to proof-read scripts or documentation. 

**ALL** issues, pull requests and comments are required to be manually written in some way by the author. If not, the maintainers in a repository will automatically delete/close the work done. If one really needs to use AI when interacting with webpack, it should be on an "assist-only" basis to fill inn small knowledge gaps, repetitive tasks or similar.

**Examples of acceptable use of AI:**

> [!NOTE]
> Most use of AI should be done locally on your machine or setup. Do not create content based on AI (as explained in this document) in our repositories or community.

- Your pull request is done but you use AI to review your work before submitting a PR.
> Example prompt `> review my pull request and suggest improvements to grammar or code style`.

- You are strugging to understand a concept such as `example.js` and ask AI to explain it to you on your local machine / environment.
> Example prompt `> explain test.js to me`

- You use AI to create the basic functionality of a larger workload such as a function named `function toDO(){// implement me}`.
> Example prompt `> Create placeholder function that implements assertions for foo bar`.

- You are writing documentation, you've filled inn the basic concepts and ask AI to suggest what else to mention. Note that this output needs to be written in a human form unless specifically given permission by any maintainer to use AI for this task.
> Example prompt `> Suggest additional information in point no.2 for me`.


**Examples of not how to use AI within webpack:**

- You ask AI to create an issue for you in webpack without any context.
> Example prompt `> create an issue in webpack that I can solve.`.

- You ask AI to fix an existing issue.
> Example prompt `> fix this error for me.`.

- You ask AI to comment or reply to a comment on your behalf.
> Example prompt `> reply with a solution to person x.`.

- You auto-fill our issue or pull request templates with AI written content.
> Example prompt `> create a pull request in webpack with my changes, describe what is done.`

- Your work is heavily based on AI input and without any clear reason.
> Example prompt `> explain this to me and commit the correct code.`
