        Please provide a minimal reproduction using:
        - GitHub repository with minimal configuration
        - Clear steps to reproduce the behavior

        **If a minimal reproduction is difficult** (e.g., performance issues in large projects with thousands of files):
        - Describe your project structure in detail
        - Include your full configuration
        - Provide specific metrics (build times, memory usage, file counts)

        Steps:
        1. Run 'npm install'
        2. Run 'npm run build'
        3. See error in console

        OR for complex cases:
        - Build takes 30+ minutes
        - Issue only appears with specific combinations of loaders/plugins
